# Advanced Github

## Description

Maintaining software or laboratory repositories are an effective way to develop and accelerate research. When working with a version control system, challenges to effective software development or documentation can arise. Learning to resolve these challenges, and ultimately avoiding them, can make the experience of collaboration on laboratory software or repositories go smoothly.

In this course, we will introduce you to advanced git version control skills. The skills learned will prepare you to merge feature branches, resolve and ultimate avoid version control conflicts, and general code hygiene. 

Introduction to Github (or similar experience) is a prerequisite for this course.

### Topics

In this course, you will: 

* Merge feature branches
* Resolve conflicts
* Cleaning a git history
* Creating MKDocs for project documentation
